              Ethan Race is a Scottish-born experimental filmmaker based in New York City. His award-winning films have been broadcast on BBC2 and showcased at venues such as BAFTA, the British Film Institute, and film festivals across the world.
              "(caught)” is a cameraless hand-painted/scratch film made on 16mm that explores the boundaries of the analogue and digital realms and our contemporary experience of being caught between the two.
              Made by applying paint and other substances directly to the film reel itself, the result is something akin to a moving painting.

              Canyon Studio creates collaborative pieces celebrating uniquely American landscapes. Each painting is inspired by a photograph and carefully translated into abstract shapes and colors. Canyon was started by two photographers smitten with road trips and American landscapes who realized they needed something textural against this one wall in their apartment. One handmade canvas and 8 hours of painting later, Canyon Studio’s first painting was born.
